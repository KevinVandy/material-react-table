## Row Ordering (DnD) Feature Guide

Material React Table has exposes all the APIs necessary to enable rich row drag and drop features that you can easily build to meet your needs. This includes the ability to reorder rows, drag rows to other tables, or drag rows to other UI in your application.

> This is not the [Sorting Guide](/docs/guides/sorting) which is a different feature.

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable
  onlyProps={
    new Set([
      'enableRowOrdering',
      'muiTableBodyRowDragHandleProps',
      'onDraggingRowChange',
      'onHoveredRowChange',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant State

<StateOptionsTable onlyProps={new Set(['draggingRow', 'hoveredRow'])} />

### Enable Row Ordering

A common use for row drag and drop is to allow users to reorder rows in a table. This can be done by setting the `enableRowOrdering` prop to `true`, and then setting up an `onDragEnd` event handler on the `muiTableBodyRowDragHandleProps` prop.

```jsx
<TailwindCSSReactTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  enableRowOrdering
  enableSorting={false} //usually you do not want to sort when re-ordering
  muiTableBodyRowDragHandleProps={{
    onDragEnd: (event, data) => {
      //data re-ordering logic here
    },
  }}
/>
```

<EnableOrderingExample />

### Drag and Drop Rows to Other UI or Tables

The Drag and Drop features are not limited to just internally within the same table. You can use them to drag rows to other UI in your application, or even to other tables. This can be done by setting the `enableRowDragging` prop to `true`, and then setting up an `onDragEnd` event handler on the `muiTableBodyRowDragHandleProps` prop to perform whatever logic you want to happen when a row is dropped.
