## Editing Feature Guide

If your tables need full CRUD functionality, you can enable editing features in Material React Table.

There are four visually distinct editing modes to choose from, whether you want to let users [edit data in a modal](#modal-editing-mode), [inline one row at a time](#row-editing-mode), [one cell at a time](#cell-editing-mode), or just always have [editing enabled for every cell](#table-editing-mode).

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable
  onlyProps={
    new Set([
      'editingMode',
      'enableEditing',
      'muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps',
      'onEditingCellChange',
      'onEditingRowCancel',
      'onEditingRowChange',
      'onEditingRowSave',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant Column Options

<ColumnOptionsTable
  onlyProps={
    new Set([
      'editSelectOptions',
      'editVariant',
      'enableEditing',
      'muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant State Options

<StateOptionsTable onlyProps={new Set(['editingCell', 'editingRow'])} />

### Enable Editing

To enable editing, you first need to set the `enableEditing` prop to `true`.

```jsx
<TailwindCSSReactTable columns={columns} data={data} enableEditing={true} />
```

However, this is just the first step. You will need to hook up logic and event listeners, but it depends on which editing mode you want to use.

### Editing Modes

Material React Table has four supported editing modes: `"modal"` (default), `"row"`, `"cell"` and `"table"`. You can specify which editing mode you want to use by passing the `editingMode` prop.

#### Modal Editing Mode

The `"modal"` editing mode opens up a dialog where the user can edit data for one row at a time. No data is saved to the table until the user clicks the save button. Clicking the cancel button clears out any changes that were made on that row.

An `onEditingRowSave` callback function prop must be provided where you will get access to the updated row data so that changes can be processed and saved. It is up to you how you handle the data. This function has a `exitEditingMode` parameter that must be called in order to exit editing mode upon save. The reason for this is so that you can perform validation checks before letting the modal close.

> The `onEditingRowSave` callback function prop includes an `exitEditingMode` parameter that must be called in order to exit editing mode upon save. The reason for this is so that you can perform validation checks before letting the modal close.

#### Row Editing Mode

The `row` editing mode is an inline row editing mode. When edit mode is activated, the row shows the edit components in the data cells. No data is saved to the table until the user clicks the save button. Clicking the cancel button clears out any changes that were made on that row.

You must provide an `onEditingRowSave` callback function prop where you will get access to the updated row data so that changes can be processed and saved. It is up to you how you handle the data. This function has a `exitEditingMode` parameter that must be called in order to exit editing mode upon save. The reason for this is so that you can perform validation checks before letting the modal close.

#### Cell Editing Mode

The `cell` editing mode is a bit simpler visually. Uses double-click cells to activate editing mode, but only for that cell.

Then there is a bit of work for you to do to wire up either the `onBlur`, `onChange`, etc., events yourself in order to save the table data. This can be done in the `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps` prop or column definition option.

<EditingCellExample />

#### Table Editing Mode

The `table` editing mode is similar to the `cell` editing mode, but it simply has all of the data cells in the table become editable all at once.

To save data, you must hook up the `onBlur`, `onChange`, etc., events yourself. This can be done in the `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps` prop or column definition option.

<EditingTableExample />

### Customizing Editing Components

You can pass any MUI TextField Props with the `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps` prop.

```tsx
const columns = [
  {
    accessor: 'age',
    header: 'Age',
    muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps: {
      required: true,
      type: 'number',
      variant: 'outlined',
    },
  },
];
```

#### Add Validation to Editing Components

You can add validation to the editing components by using the `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps` events. You can write your validation logic and hook it up to the `onBlur`, `onChange`, etc., events, then set the `error` and `helperText` props accordingly.

If you are implementing validation, you may also need to use the `onEditingRowCancel` prop to clear the validation error state.

```tsx
const [validationErrors, setValidationErrors] = useState({});

const columns = [
  {
    accessor: 'age',
    header: 'Age',
    muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps: {
      error: !!validationErrors.age, //highlight mui text field red error color
      helperText: validationErrors.age, //show error message in helper text.
      required: true,
      type: 'number',
      onChange: (event) => {
        const value = event.target.value;
        //validation logic
        if (!value) {
          setValidationErrors((prev) => ({ ...prev, age: 'Age is required' }));
        } else if (value < 18) {
          setValidationErrors({
            ...validationErrors,
            age: 'Age must be 18 or older',
          });
        } else {
          delete validationErrors.age;
          setValidationErrors({ ...validationErrors });
        }
      },
    },
  },
];
```

### Use Custom Editing Components

If you need to use a much more complicated Editing component than the built-in textfield, you can specify a custom editing component with the `Edit` column definition option.

```tsx
const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'email',
    header: 'Email',
    Edit: ({ cell, column, table }) => <Autocomplete />,
  },
];
```

### Customize Actions/Edit Column

You can customize the actions column in a few different ways in the `displayColumnDefOptions` prop's `'mrt-row-actions'` section.

```tsx
<TailwindCSSReactTable
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  displayColumnDefOptions={{
    'mrt-row-actions': {
      header: 'Edit', //change "Actions" to "Edit"
      //use a text button instead of a icon button
      Cell: ({ row, table }) => (
        <Button onClick={() => table.setEditingRow(row)}>Edit Customer</Button>
      ),
    },
  }}
/>
```
