## Density Toggle Feature Guide

Material React Table includes a density toggle button in the top toolbar by default that lets you toggle between three different density levels. This is a great feature to include to help with accessibility for different user preferences, but it can also easily be disabled if desired.

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable
  onlyProps={new Set(['enableDensityToggle', 'onDensityChange'])}
/>

### Relevant State

<StateOptionsTable onlyProps={new Set(['density'])} />

### Default Density

By default, Material React Table will render with a medium `comfortable` density.

A density toggle is shown by default to let a user change the density to cycle through `spacious`, `comfortable`, and `compact` densities.

> When a `compact` density is set, whitespace is set to `nowrap` by default to keep the rows as short in height as possible. This can be overridden in the `muiTableBodyCellProps` styles or sx prop.

#### Change Default Density

If you want to change the default density, you can set it in either the `initialState` prop or the `state` prop.

```tsx
<TailwindCSSReactTable
  data={data}
  columns={columns}
  initialState={{ density: 'compact' }}
/>
```

### Disable or Hide the Density Toggle

You can change the default density and disable the density toggle itself if you want.

In this example, the density toggle is disabled and a `compact` density is set by default in the `initialState` prop.
