## Minimal Example

TailwindCSS React Table gives you a lot out of the box, but it's also easy to turn off any features that you do not need.

Every feature has an `enable...` prop that let's you turn it on or off.

For example, you can turn off sorting or hide the top or bottom toolbars if you want.
