## Editing (CRUD) Example

Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality can be easily implemented with Material React Table, with a combination of editing, toolbar, and row action features.

This example below uses the default [`"modal"`](/docs/guides/editing#modal-editing-mode) editing mode, where a dialog opens up to edit 1 row at a time. However be sure to check out the other editing modes and see if they fit your use case better. Other editing modes include [`"row"`](/docs/guides/editing#row-editing-mode) (1 row inline at a time), [`"cell"`](/docs/guides/editing#cell-editing-mode) (1 cell inline at time), and [`"table"`](/docs/guides/editing#table-editing-mode) (all cells always editable).
