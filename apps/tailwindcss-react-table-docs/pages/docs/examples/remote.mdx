## Remote Data Fetching Example

You will most likely be using a remote data source for your table, which is fully supported. Here is an example of data being fetched from a remote server but also filtered, paginated, and sorted on the server.

Also, be sure to check out the [React Query Example](/docs/examples/react-query), which is very similar to this one, except it uses react-query to simplify much of the state management needed for fetching data, so that you don't need to fetch from a `useEffect` hook.
