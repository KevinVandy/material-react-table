## Data Export Example

Material React Table does not have a data exporting feature built in. However, you can easily integrate your own exporting feature, if desired.

In the example below, `export-to-csv` is connected to some export buttons in the top toolbar. If you need to export in Excel or PDF format, there are a variety of NPM packages that can be used to export in these formats.
