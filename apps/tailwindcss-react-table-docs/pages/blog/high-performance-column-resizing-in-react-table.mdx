## High Performance Column Resizing in React Table

<BlogAuthor publishDate="2023/01/01" />

_This blog post also appears on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kevinvancott/the-best-react-data-grid-table-libraries-with-material-design-in-2023-690508de8b61)._

So you've decided to use TanStack React Table to build a DataGrid/Table component for your application. You've got the basic functionality working, but you're noticing that the column resizing is a bit laggy, and it gets more and more noticeable as you add more features, or show more columns and rows.

When I built my MRT libraries built on top of TanStack Table, I ran into the same issue, and received a few complaints from developers using MRT.
