## State Management Guide

> Note: `tableInstanceRef` has been removed in MRT v2 since the `useMaterialReactTable` hook now returns the table instance directly. See the [Migration Guide](/migrating-to-v2) for more information.

Material React Table does not try to hide any of its internal state from you. You can initialize state with custom initial values, manage individual states yourself as you discover the need to have access to them, or read any of the state from the table instance itself.

This is all optional, of course. If you do not need access to any of the internal state, you do not need to do anything and it will just automatically be managed internally.

See the [State Options API Docs](/docs/api/state-options) for more information on which states are available for you to manage.

### Relevant Table Options

<TableOptionsTable onlyOptions={new Set(['initialState', 'state'])} />

### Populate Initial State

If all you care about is setting parts of the initial or default state when the table mounts, then you may be able to specify that state in the `initialState` table option and not have to worry about managing the state yourself.

For example, let's say you do not need access to the `showColumnFilters` state, but you want to set the default value to `true` when the table mounts. You can do that with the `initialState` table option:

```jsx
const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  initialState: {
    density: 'xs', //set default density to compact
    expanded: true, //expand all rows by default
    pagination: { pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 15 }, //set different default page size
    showColumnFilters: true, //show filters by default
    sorting: [{ id: 'name', desc: false }], //sort by name ascending by default
  },
});

return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
```

> Note: If you use both `initialState` and `state`, the state initializer in `state` table option will take precedence and overwrite the same state values in `initialState`. So just use either `initialState` or `state`, not both for the same states.

### Manage Individual States as Needed

It is pretty common to need to manage certain state yourself, so that you can react to changes in that state, or have easy access to it when sending it to an API.

You can pass in any state that you are managing yourself to the `state` table option, and it will be used instead of the internal state. Each state property option also has a corresponding `on[StateName]Change` callback that you can use set/update your managed state as it changes internally in the table.

For example, let's say you need to store the pagination, sorting, and row selection states in a place where you can easily access it in order to use it in parameters for an API call.

```jsx
const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({
  pageIndex: 0,
  pageSize: 15, //set different default page size by initializing the state here
});
const [rowSelection, setRowSelection] = useState({});
const [sorting, setSorting] = useState([{ id: 'name', desc: false }]);

//see example at bottom of page for alternatives to useEffect here
useEffect(() => {
  //do something when the pagination state changes
}, [pagination]);

const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  getRowId: (originalRow) => row.username,
  onPaginationChange: setPagination,
  onRowSelectionChange: setRowSelection,
  onSortingChange: setSorting,
  state: { pagination, rowSelection, sorting }, //must pass states back down if using their on[StateName]Change callbacks
});

return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
```

### Add Side Effects in Set State Callbacks

In React 18 and beyond, it is becoming more discouraged to use `useEffect` to react to state changes, because in React Strict Mode (and maybe future versions of React), the useEffect hook may run twice per render. Instead, more event driven functions are recommended to be used. Here is an example for how that looks here. The callback signature for the `on[StateName]Change` works just like a React setState callback from the `useState` hook. This means that you have to check if the updater is a function or not, and then call the setState function with the updater callback if it is a function.

```tsx
const [pagination, setPagination] = useState({
  pageIndex: 0,
  pageSize: 15,
});

const handlePaginationChange = (updater: MRT_Updater<PaginationState>) => {
  //call the setState as normal, but need to check if using an updater callback with a previous state
  setPagination((prevPagination) =>
    //if updater is a function, call it with the previous state, otherwise just use the updater value
    updater instanceof Function ? updater(prevPagination) : updater,
  );
  //put more code for your side effects here, guaranteed to only run once, even in React Strict Mode
};

const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  onPaginationChange: handlePaginationChange,
  state: { pagination },
});

return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
```

### Read From the Table Instance

> Note: Previously, in early MRT v1, you could use the `tableInstanceRef` table option to get access to the table instance. This is no longer necessary as the `useMaterialReactTable` hook now just returns the table instance directly.

The `useMaterialReactTable` hook returns the table instance. The `<MaterialReactTable />` needs the table instance for all of its internal logic, but you can also use it for your own purposes.

```jsx
const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  //...
});

const someEventHandler = (event) => {
  console.info(table.getRowModel().rows); //example - get access to all page rows in the table
  console.info(table.getSelectedRowModel()); //example - get access to all selected rows in the table
  console.info(table.getState().sorting); //example - get access to the current sorting state without having to manage it yourself
};

return (
  <div>
    <ExternalButton onClick={someEventHandler}>
      Export or Something
    </ExternalButton>
    <MaterialReactTable table={table} />
  </div>
);
```

The table instance is the same object that you will also see as a provided parameter in many of the other callback functions throughout Material React Table, such as all the `render...` props or the `Cell` or `Header` render overrides in the column definition options.

```jsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      Header: 'Name',
      accessor: 'name',
      Cell: ({ cell, table }) => <span>{cell.getValue()}</span>,
      //The `table` parameter from the Cell option params and the `table` are the same object
    },
  ],
  [],
);

const table = useMaterialReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  renderTopToolbarCustomActions: ({ table }) => {
    //The `table` parameter here and the table returned from the hook are the same object
    return <Button>Button</Button>;
  },
});

return <MaterialReactTable table={table} />;
```

### Persistent State

Persistent state is not a built-in feature of Material React Table, but it is an easy feature to implement yourself using the above patterns with the `state` table option and the `on[StateName]Change` callbacks. Here is an example of how you might implement persistent state using `sessionStorage`:
