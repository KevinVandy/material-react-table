## Migrating to Material React Table V2 from V1

This should be an easy to moderate upgrade for most developers. The only breaking changes have to do with the removed `tableInstanceRef`, some renamed props/options, and new column sizing behaviors.

> Note: As of v2.12.0, the React and ReactDom peer dependencies have been moved back down to React v17 in order to help more people upgrade to MRT v2 without having to upgrade to React v18.

### New Feature Highlights

1. New optional but recommended `useMaterialReactTable` hook that allows you to create the `table` instance in your own scope
2. Greatly improved editing and new creating features
3. New row pinning Features
4. New column filtering `'popover'` display mode to give a more "Excel-like" filtering experience
5. New autocomplete, date, and date range filter variants
6. New pagination UI options
7. New alert banner UI options and overrides available
8. New loading overlay UI
9. Improved table head cell default styles
10. Improved column sizing and layout modes for column resizing features
11. All internal MRT components are now exported for custom headless use cases
12. New optional `createMRTColumnHelper` utility function for better `TValue`/`cell.getValue()` type inference
13. Many more features are compatible with virtualization

See the full [changelog](/changelog#version-2.0.0---10-27-2023) for more details.

### Upgrade Dependencies

Run this command to set the `material-react-table` dependency to the latest version in your `package.json`. This will not perform the full install yet.

```bash
npx npm-check-updates -u material-react-table
```

Your `package.json` should have `"material-react-table": "^2.x.x"` as a dependency.

Then run the install command again. Either `npm i`, `pnpm i`, or `yarn`, etc. Or run the full command below to make sure all MUI dependencies are also upgraded or installed.

<InstallCommand />

### Breaking Changes

- `@mui/x-date-pickers v >=6.15.0` is now a required peer dependency. If not already installed from the previous step, install it with:

<InstallCommand packagesString="@mui/x-date-pickers" />

- If you use the date picker features, you will also need to import the `LocalizationProvider` from `@mui/x-date-pickers` and wrap your app in it. Click [here](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/adapters-locale/) for more details.

```jsx
import { LocalizationProvider } from '@mui/x-date-pickers';
import { AdapterDayjs } from '@mui/x-date-pickers/AdapterDayjs';

export const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={createTheme({})}>
      {/* Add this if using date filter features */}
      <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDayjs}>
        <MyApp />
      </LocalizationProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

- `MaterialReactTable` is now a named export instead of a default export. Use curly braces to import it.

```diff
- import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table'
+ import { MaterialReactTable, useMaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table'
```

- The `tableInstanceRef` prop has been replaced by the `useMaterialReactTable` hook, which is much easier to use. It is also recommended that all table options be passed to the new `useMaterialReactTable` hook instead as props to the `<MaterialReactTable />` component. See [below](#usematerialreacttable) for more details.

#### Renamed Props/Options

- `editingMode` -> `editDisplayMode`
- `rowNumberMode` -> `rowNumberDisplayMode`
- `enablePinning` -> `enableColumnPinning` and `enableRowPinning`
- `virtualizerInstanceRef` split into `columnVirtualizerRef` and `rowVirtualizerRef`
- `virtualizerProps` split into `columnVirtualizerOptions` and `rowVirtualizerOptions`
- `columnVirtualizerProps` -> `columnVirtualizerOptions`
- `rowVirtualizerProps` -> `rowVirtualizerOptions`
- `muiTablePaginationProps` -> `muiPaginationProps`
- `muiTableBodyCellCopyButtonProps` -> `muiCopyButtonProps`
- `muiTableBodyCellEditTextFieldProps` -> `muiEditTextFieldProps`
- `muiTableBodyCellSkeletonProps` -> `muiSkeletonProps`
- `muiTableBodyRowDragHandleProps` -> `muiRowDragHandleProps`
- `muiTableDetailPanelProps` -> `muiDetailPanelProps`
- `muiTableHeadCellColumnActionsButtonProps` -> `muiColumnActionsButtonProps`
- `muiTableHeadCellDragHandleProps` -> `muiColumnDragHandleProps`
- `muiTableHeadCellFilterCheckboxProps` -> `muiFilterCheckboxProps`
- `muiTableHeadCellFilterTextFieldProps` -> `muiFilterTextFieldProps`
- `muiTableHeadCellFilterSliderProps` -> `muiFilterSliderProps`
- `MRT_FilterFnsState` -> `MRT_ColumnFilterFns`
- `MaterialReactTableProps` -> `MRT_TableOptions`
- `MRT_FullScreenToggleButton` => `MRT_ToggleFullScreenButton`

### useMaterialReactTable

Passing all table options as props to `<MaterialReactTable />` still works, but there now is an improved way to define table options with the `useMaterialReactTable` hook.

For example, here is a classic example for how to use Material React Table in V1 (still works in v2):

```jsx
import { MaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table';

export const MyTableComponent = () => {
  // const tableInstanceRef = useRef(); //deprecated

  return (
    //Defining table options as props to <MaterialReactTable /> still works (as long as you don't also pass in a table prop)
    <MaterialReactTable
      columns={columns}
      data={data}
      enableRowSelection //table options as props
      // tableInstanceRef={tableInstanceRef} //deprecated
    />
  );
};
```

But you can now define all table options in the `useMaterialReactTable`.

```jsx
import {
  MaterialReactTable,
  useMaterialReactTable,
} from 'material-react-table';

export const MyTableComponent = () => {
  const table = useMaterialReactTable({
    columns,
    data,
    enableRowSelection: true, //table options as options to this hook
  });

  return (
    <MaterialReactTable
      table={table} //only pass in table instead of all table options
    />
  );
};
```

### Why is useMaterialReactTable Better?

There are a few reasons why having full access to the `table` instance is better than having MRT create it under the hood for you.

1. There is no longer a need for a confusing `tableInstanceRef` prop that doesn't properly cause re-renders when the table instance changes. Now, any component that consumes the `table` instance will properly re-render when the table instance changes.

2. It allows you to not have to use all of Material React Table's components. For example, if you only want to use the `Table` component with no TableContainer or Toolbars, you can simply import a different component from Material React Table.

```jsx
import { MRT_Table, useMaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table';

export const MyTableComponent = () => {
  const table = useMaterialReactTable({
    columns,
    data,
    enableRowSelection: true,
  });

  const selectedRows = table.getSelectedRowModel().rows;
  console.log(selectedRows);

  return (
    //this internal sub-component does not include the Paper, TableContainer, or Toolbars (lighter weight)
    <MRT_Table table={table} />
  );
};
```

### Column Sizing and Layout Modes

There are some new column sizing behaviors to be aware of in v2.

In addition to the `"semantic"` and `"grid"` layoutModes, there is now a new `"grid-no-grow"` layoutMode that is automatically enabled by default when `enableColumnResizing` is `true`.

This new layoutMode keeps columns in a fixed width, and columns will not grow to fill any remaining horizontal space. This is likely a very welcome change for most, but you can revert the behavior back to the old behavior by setting the layoutMode table option to `"grid"` or `"semantic"` manually.

If you were previously trying to accomplish the same `"grid-no-grow"` by setting the flex-grow CSS to 0 in V1, it is recommended that you now remove that CSS in favor of simply using the new `"grid-no-grow"` layoutMode, which will also add an invisible `"mrt-row-spacer"` display column that makes the row borders look better.

```diff
- muiTableHeadCellProps={{
-   sx: {
-     flex: '0 0 auto',
-   },
- }}
- muiTableBodyCellProps={{
-   sx: {
-     flex: '0 0 auto',
-   },
- }}
+ layoutMode="grid-no-grow"
```
