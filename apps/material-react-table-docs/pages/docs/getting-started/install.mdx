## Installation

> `material-react-table` requires **Material UI V5** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Material UI, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mui/material` (v5)
> 2.  `@mui/x-date-pickers` (v6) - (New in MRT v2)
> 3.  `@mui/icons-material` (v5)
> 4.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 5.  `@emotion/styled` (v11)
> 6.  `react` and `react-dom` (v18) - (MRT v2 will eventually use React 18 concurrent mode)

### Quick Install

<InstallCommand packagesString="material-react-table" />

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

<InstallCommand />

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `material-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `highlight-words`

### Common Errors

If you get an error like this:

```bash
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You might be trying to import `MaterialReactTable` from the default export still, which is no longer supported in v2. Make sure you are importing the named export instead:

```diff
- import MaterialReactTable from 'material-react-table'
+ import { MaterialReactTable } from 'material-react-table'
```

Or you probably do not have the correct version of Material UI installed. Make sure all material ui packages are at least v5.11 or higher.

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bash
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.
