</Head>

## Installation

> `material-react-table` requires **Material UI V5** packages as dependencies in your project.
>
> If you are already using Material UI, you probably already have most of these peer dependencies installed.
>
> Just double-check that you have the following in your package.json, or use the [full install commands](<#install-with-required-peer-dependencies-(recommended)>) below.
>
> 1.  `@mui/material` (v5)
> 2.  `@mui/icons-material` (v5)
> 3.  `@emotion/react` (v11)
> 4.  `@emotion/styled` (v11)
> 5.  `react` and `react-dom` (v17 or v18) - Material UI v5 requires React 17 or 18

### Quick Install

NPM

```bash
npm install material-react-table
```

PNPM

```bash
pnpm add material-react-table
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add material-react-table
```

### Install With Required Peer Dependencies (Recommended)

NPM

```bash
npm install material-react-table @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

PNPM

```bash
pnpm add material-react-table @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

Yarn

```bash
yarn add material-react-table @mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

> You do NOT need to install `@tanstack/react-table`, as it is already an internal dependency of `material-react-table`, and must use an exact version already specified internally.
>
> All internal dependencies: `@tanstack/match-sorter-utils`, `@tanstack/react-table`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, and `highlight-words`

### Common Errors

If you get an error like this:

```bash
"Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components)
or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in,
or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

You probably do not have the correct version of Material UI installed. Make sure all material ui packages are at least v5

If you are using an older version of `webpack` or `create-react-app` and get an error like this:

```bash
./node_modules/@tanstack/virtual-core/build/lib/index.esm.js 147:92
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (147:92)
File was processed with these loaders:
```

Then try upgrading either `webpack` or `react-scripts` to the latest versions.
