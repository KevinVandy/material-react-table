## Advanced Example

Here is a more advanced example showcasing Material React Table's many features. Features such as row selection, expanding detail panels, header groups, column ordering, column pinning, column grouping, custom column and cell renders, etc., can be seen here.

This example is still only using client-side features. If you want to see an example of how to use Material React Table with server side logic and remote data, check out either the [Remote&nbsp;Data&nbsp;Example](/docs/examples/remote) or the [React-Query Example](/docs/examples/react-query).
