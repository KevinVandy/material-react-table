## Row Virtualization Example

Material React Table has a built-in row virtualization feature (via [`@tanstack/react-virtual`](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3)) that allows you to render a large number of rows without major performance issues that you would normally see with a large number of DOM elements.

Try out the performance of the table below with **10,000 rows**! Filtering, Search, and Sorting also maintain usable performance.

Be sure to also check out the full [virtualization feature guide docs](/docs/guides/virtualization) to learn about both Row and Column Virtualization.

> NOTE: You should only enable row virtualization if you have a large number of rows or columns. Depending on the size of the table, if you are rendering fewer than a couple dozen rows at a time, you will actually just be adding extra overhead to the table renders. Virtualization only becomes necessary when you have over 50 rows or so at the same time with no pagination or dozens of columns.
