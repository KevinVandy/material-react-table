## Editing (CRUD) Tree Example

Editing nested row data can be challenging. In this example, rows can be expanded to show sub rows, and editing and creating new rows can be done at any level.

Adding a new blank row in the exact row index position is now possible with the new `positionCreatingRow` table option.

This example also shows some complex client-side optimistic updates, where the table data is updated immediately after a valid user action.
