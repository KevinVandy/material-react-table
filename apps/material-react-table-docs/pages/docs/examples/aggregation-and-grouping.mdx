## Aggregation Example

Grouping and Aggregation features are usually hard to implement, but MRT (thanks to [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/api/features/grouping)) makes it easy. Once enabled, simply click the vertical ellipses (⋮) icon for the column you want to group by and select **Group by (column name)**.

You can group by a single column or multiple columns at a time. Then, you can run aggregations on grouped columns to calculate totals, averages, max, min, etc.

The Grouping and Aggregation features work hand in hand with the Expanding and Sorting features. Try grouping by various columns in the example below and sorting by the aggregated columns, such as "age" or "salary".

See the [Column Grouping](/docs/features/column-grouping) and [Aggregation](/docs/features/aggregation) docs for more information.
