## Filter Variants Example

Material React Table not only has filtering built in, but it also has a lot of different filter variants that take care of a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Text filters, date filters, range filters, range slider filters, and more are all built in and ready to use. There is much more you can do to customize the behavior of filtering, so be sure to check out the full [Column Filtering Feature Guide](/docs/guides/column-filtering) for more information.
