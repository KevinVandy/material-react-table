## Sticky Row Pinning Example

Material React Table has the ability to pin rows and keep them in view while scrolling. In this example, when rows are pinned, they will initially appear to stay in place, but when the user scrolls up or down, the rows will stick to the top or bottom of the table. Learn more about row pinning in the [Row Pinning Feature Guide](/docs/guides/row-pinning).
