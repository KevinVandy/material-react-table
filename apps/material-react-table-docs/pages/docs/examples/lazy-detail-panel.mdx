## Lazy Detail Panel Example

Fetching the additional data for the detail panels only after the user clicks to expand the row can be a good way to improve performance, and it is pretty easy to implement in Material React Table.

It's even easier if you are using [React Query.](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) In this example, react query is used to fetch the data for the detail panel, but only after the user clicks to expand the row. The data is also cached for a certain period of time so that when the detail panel is closed and reopened, the data is already available and won't need to be re-fetched.
