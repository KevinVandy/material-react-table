## Chart Detail Panel Example

The detail panel features can be used for a variety of purposes. In this example, we are integrating the new [MUI X Charts](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/getting-started/) library to display an expandable line chart for each row.

You could, of course, use any charting library that you prefer, but using MUI X Charts will give you a consistent look and feel with Material React Table and any other Material UI components you may be using.
