## Lazy Sub-Rows Example

If you have a ton of nested data that you want to display, but you don't want to fetch it all up front, you can set up Material React Table to only fetch the sub-rows data when the user expands the row.

There are quite a few ways in which you could implement fetching sub-rows lazily. This example is just one way to do it.

This example combines concepts from the [React Query Example](/docs/examples/react-query) and the [Expanding Parsed Tree Example](/docs/examples/expanding-tree-flat-parse).
