## Custom Headless Example

For advanced use cases where you want to be in 100% control of your UI components, you can use Material React Table in a more headless way, kind of like how you would use [stock TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/examples/react/basic).

The power and flexibility here is almost limitless, as you can combine some already built-in Material React Table components alongside your own custom components. For the MRT components to work properly, all you need to do is pass the `table` object returned from the `useMaterialReactTable` hook.
