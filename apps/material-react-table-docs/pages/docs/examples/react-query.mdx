## React Query (Remote) Example

This is just like the [Remote Data Fetching Example](/docs/examples/remote), but react-query is used to simplify all the state management of the fetching and loading of data.

[React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) is by far the best way to fetch remote data in React. It has features like caching, refetching, polling, pagination, and more that work together very well with table logic as seen in this example.

Also, be sure to check out the [Virtualized Example](/docs/examples/virtualized), which shows off the use of another TanStack library, [React Virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3), to render thousands of rows at once while still maintaining great performance.
