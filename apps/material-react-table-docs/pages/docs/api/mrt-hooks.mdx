## MRT Hooks

### useMaterialReactTable

The main hook from Material React Table. It creates a TanStack Table instance with all of the features that MRT provides and that you enable.

### useMaterialReactTableLight

> Would you be interested in a "lightweight" version MRT that doesn't import all of the features from TanStack Table by default? If so, voice your opinion in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/5wqyRx6fnm). It may be added in a near future non-major feature release.
