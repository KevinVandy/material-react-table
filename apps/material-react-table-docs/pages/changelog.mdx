- V0.19.0 - `instance` was renamed to `table` across all callback functions to be inline with TanStack Table V8.1.

## Roadmap

### Version 1 Roadmap (2022-2023)

Most of the features that will ever be added in Version 1 have been added. They will continue to be polished, and bugs will continue to be fixed.

One area of focus, however, will be improving the editing features. There is still some room for improvement and quality of life improvements that can be made.

Another large feature that could be added is a "row pinning" feature. It would allow users to pin rows to the top of the table, and would be useful for things like "favorites" or "pinned" rows. It would work very similarly to the "column pinning" feature that is already in the table.

### Version 2 Roadmap (2023)

Version 2 will probably not come out until Material UI v6 is released. It will be developed while Material UI v6 is in alpha, and will be released when Material UI v6 is released.
