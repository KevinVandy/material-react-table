## Roadmap

### Version 2 Roadmap (2023)

Material React Table V2 was a big release months in the making that mostly focussed on the new `useMaterialReactTable` hook and paradigms. New features will be added and many bug fixes around virtualization compatibility with advanced features will be prioritized first.

A lighter weight `useMaterialReactTableLight` hook is also being considered in the near future that will be a bit more bare-bones and tree-shakable. All features will be opt-in and will not be enabled by default.
