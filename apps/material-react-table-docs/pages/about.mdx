## About Material React Table

Material React Table is a fully featured Material UI V5 implementation of TanStack React Table V8, written from the ground up in TypeScript.

### What is Material React Table?

Material React Table (MRT) is a fully-featured data grid/table component library for React built on [TanStack Table V8's](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) powerful API. MRT is meant to work best in projects already using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) components, but it is not necessarily required. However, be aware that [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) are required as peer dependencies for MRT to work.

If you are a Tailwind or native CSS user, check out [Mantine React Table](https://www.mantine-react-table.com) instead, which is a sister library to MRT that uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) components instead of Material UI and is a bit more Tailwind friendly.

MRT is built from the ground up in TypeScript, and is designed to have a great type-safe dev experience with generics that react to the data structures you pass in. TypeScript is not at all required to use MRT, but it is recommended for the best and fastest developer experience, especially when defining columns.

> Material React Table has a sister library, [Mantine React Table](https://www.mantine-react-table.com) that uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) components instead of Material UI, but otherwise has the same API. Check it out if you're looking for a Material UI alternative.

### Motivation

Material React Table started out as an attempt to upgrade the once popular [material-table](https://material-table.com/) library to Material UI v5 and TypeScript, since that project seemed to have become abandoned. However, after a few frustrating weeks, it was discovered that it would be easier and more fun to write a new advanced Material UI table library from scratch. [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) naturally seemed like a great basis for the underlying API and therefore was chosen as the foundation for the project.

Material React Table is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table/blob/v2/LICENSE) and is free to use in both personal and commercial projects.

If you are already using <b>Material UI</b> for other components in your project, and are looking for a efficient and fully featured data grid component to drop in, this may be the perfect library for you. MRT is not necessarily the lightest weight table library out there, but it has a much <b>smaller bundle size</b> than similar libraries like material-table. If you are looking for the most powerful data grid possible, <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/" target="_blank"><b>AG Grid</b></a> is still recommended above MRT as long as you do not care about bundle size.</p>',
