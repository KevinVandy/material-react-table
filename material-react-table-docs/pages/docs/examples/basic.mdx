To get started creating a basic table, all you need to do is to provide the **columns** definitions and the table **data**.

```jsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns} //must be memoized
  data={data} //must be memoized
/>
```

> **Note:** It is very important to memoize both the columns and the data that you pass to MaterialReactTable. Otherwise, the entire table will be re-rendered during every react render in your application, and can lead to performance issues.
