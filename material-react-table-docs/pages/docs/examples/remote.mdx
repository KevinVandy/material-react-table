## Remote Data Example

More than likely you will be using a remote data source for your table. This is fully supported. Here is an example where data is fetched from a remote server, but also filtered, paginated, and sorted on the server.

Also be sure to check out the [TanStack React Query Example](/docs/examples/react-query) which is very similar to this one, but uses react-query to simplify much of the state management needed for fetching data.
