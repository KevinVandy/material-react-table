## Column Resizing Feature Guide

Material React Table let's you easily change the default widths (sizes) of columns, and has a built-in column resizing draggable handle feature.

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable
  onlyProps={
    new Set([
      'columnResizeMode',
      'defaultColumn',
      'enableColumnResizing',
      'onColumnSizingChange',
      'onColumnSizingInfoChange',
    ])
  }
/>

### Relevant Column Options

<ColumnOptionsTable
  onlyProps={new Set(['enableResizing', 'maxSize', 'minSize', 'size'])}
/>

### Relevant State

<StateOptionsTable onlyProps={new Set(['columnSizing', 'columnSizingInfo'])} />

### Change Default Column Widths

#### Column Size

This was also covered in the [Data Columns Guide](/docs/guides/data-columns), but we'll cover it again here.

You can change the width of any column by setting its `size` option on the column definition. `minSize` and `maxSize` are also available to enforce limits during resizing.

```tsx
const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'id',
    header: 'ID',
    size: 50, //small column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'username',
    header: 'Username',
    minSize: 100, //min size enforced during resizing
    maxSize: 200, //max size enforced during resizing
    size: 180, //medium column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'email',
    header: 'Email',
    size: 300, //large column
  },
];
```

You may notice however, that the columns may be not change their size as much as you would expect. This is because the browser treats `<th>` and `<td>` elements differently with in a `<table>` element by default.

You can improve this slightly by changing the table layout to `fixed` instead of the default `auto` in the `muiTableProps`.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  muiTableProps={{
    sx: {
      tableLayout: 'fixed',
    },
  }}
/>
```

The Columns will still try to increase their width to take up the full width of the table, but the columns that do have a defined size will have their width respected more.

For further reading on how table-layout `fixed` vs `auto` works, we recommend this [blog post](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/table-layout/) by CSS-Tricks.

#### Default Column

By default, columns will have these size properties defined:

```tsx
defaultColumn = { minSize: 40, maxSize: 1000, size: 180 }; //units are in px
```

You can modify the default column widths by setting the `defaultColumn` prop on the table.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  defaultColumn={{
    minSize: 20, //allow columns to get smaller than default
    maxSize: 9001, //allow columns to get larger than default
    size: 260, //make columns wider by default
  }}
/>
```

### Enable Column Resizing Feature

`enableColumnResizing` is the boolean prop that enables the column resizing feature.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable columns={columns} data={data} enableColumnResizing />
```

You can disable specific columns from being resizable by setting the `enableResizing` column option to false in their respective column definition.

> When Column Resizing is enabled, a CSS `table-layout: fixed` style is automatically added to the `<table>` element in order to make the browser respect the widths of the columns more.

#### Column Resize Mode

The default `columnResizeMode` is `onEnd`, which means that the column resizing will only occur after the user has finished dragging the column resize handle and released their mouse. You can change the `columnResizeMode` to `onChange` to make the column resizing occur immediately as the user drags the column resize handle.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  enableColumnResizing
  columnResizeMode="onChange"
/>
```
