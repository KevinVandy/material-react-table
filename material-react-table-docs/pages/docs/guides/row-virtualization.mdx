## Row Virtualization Feature Guide

Virtualization is useful when you have a lot of data you want to display client-side all at once, without having to use pagination. Material React Table makes this as simple as possible, thanks to [`@tanstack/react-virtual`](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3).

> NOTE: You should only enable row virtualization if you have a large number of rows. Depending on the size of the table, if you are rendering less than a couple dozen rows at a time, you will actually just be adding extra overhead to the table renders. Virtualization only becomes necessary when you have over 100 rows or so at the same time with no pagination.

### Relevant Props

<RootPropTable
  onlyProps={
    new Set([
      'enableRowVirtualization',
      'virtualizerProps',
      'virtualizerInstanceRef',
    ])
  }
/>

### What is Virtualization?

Virtualization, or virtual scrolling, works by only rendering the rows that are visible on the screen. This is useful for performance and user experience, as we can make it appear that there are hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of rows in the table all at once, but in reality, the table will only render the couple dozen rows that are visible on the screen.

### Does Your Table Even Need Virtualization?

If your table is already paginated, you probably don't need virtualization. If your table is not rendering more than 100 rows at a time, you might not really need virtualization.

There is a tiny bit of extra overhead that gets added to your table's rendering when virtualization is enabled, so don't just enable it for every table. That being said, if your table does have well over 100 rows that it is trying to render all at once without pagination, performance will be night and day once it is enabled.

### Enable Row Virtualization

Enabling row virtualization is as simple as setting the `enableRowVirtualization` prop to `true`. However, you will probably also want to turn off pagination, which you can do by setting `enablePagination` to `false`.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  enablePagination={false}
  enableRowVirtualization
/>
```

> WARNING: Don't enable row virtualization conditionally. It may break React's Rule of Hooks, and/or cause other UI jumpiness.

### Row Virtualization Side Effects

When Row Virtualization is enabled, a CSS `table-layout: fixed` style is automatically added to the `<table>` element to prevent columns wiggling back and forth during scrolling due to body cells having variating widths.

This means that you may want to manually specify the width of all of your columns in the column definitions with the `size` option, since the browser will no longer automatically make columns wider as needed.

For further reading on how table-layout `fixed` vs `auto` works, we recommend this [blog post](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/table-layout/) by CSS-Tricks.

### Customize Virtualizer Props

You can adjust some of the virtualizer props that are used internally. The most useful ones are the `overscan` and `estimateHeight` options. You may want to adjust these values if you have unusual row heights that is causing the default scrolling to act weirdly.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  columns={columns}
  data={data}
  enablePagination={false}
  enableRowVirtualization
  virtualizerProps={{
    overscan: 25, //adjust the number or rows that are rendered above and below the visible area of the table
    estimateHeight: () => 200, //if your rows are about 200px tall, could try this
  }}
/>
```

See the official TanStack [Virtualizer Options API Docs](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3/docs/api/virtualizer#optional-options) for more information.

### Access Underlying Virtualizer Instance

In a similar way that you can [access the underlying table instance](/docs/guides/table-state-management#access-the-underlying-table-instance-reference), you can also access the underlying virtualizer instance. This can be useful for accessing methods like the `scrollToIndex` method, which can be used to programmatically scroll to a specific row.

```tsx
const virtualizerInstanceRef = useRef<Virtualizer>(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (virtualizerInstanceRef.current) {
    //scroll to the top of the table when sorting changes
    virtualizerInstanceRef.current.scrollToIndex(0);
  }
}, [sorting]);

return (
  <MaterialReactTable
    columns={columns}
    data={data}
    enableRowVirtualization
    virtualizerInstanceRef={virtualizerInstanceRef}
  />
);
```

See the official TanStack [Virtualizer Instance API Docs](https://tanstack.com/virtual/v3/docs/api/virtualizer#virtualizer-instance) for more information.
