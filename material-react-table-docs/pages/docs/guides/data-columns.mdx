## Data Columns

Data Columns are the columns that are used to display data. They are the default columns that are created when you create a column with an `accessorKey` or `accessorFn`.

The table can perform processing on the data of a Data Column, such as sorting, filtering, grouping, etc.

The other type of column that you can make is a "Display Column", which you can learn more about in the [next section](/docs/guides/display-columns).

### Accessors (Connect a column to data)

Each column definition must have, at the very least, an `accessorKey` (or a combination of an `id` and `accessorFn`) and a `header` property. The `accessorKey`/`accessorFn` property is the key that will be used to join the data from the `data` keys. The `header` property is used to display the column header, but is also used in other places in the table.

#### Method 1 - Using an accessorKey (Recommended)

The simplest and most common way to define a column is to use the `accessorKey` property. The `accessorKey` property is the key that will be used to join the data from the `data` keys.

The `accessorKey` must match one of the keys in your data, or else no data will show up in the column. The `accessorKey` also supports dot notation, so you can access nested data.

By default, the `accessorKey` will double as the `id` for the column, but if you need the id of the column to be different than the accessorKey, you can use the `id` property in addition.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo<MRT_ColumnDef<Customer>[]>( //TS helps with the autocomplete while writing columns
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'username', //normal recommended usage of an accessorKey
      header: 'Username',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'name.firstName', //example of dot notation used to access nested data
      header: 'First Name',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'name.lastName', //example of dot notation used to access nested data
      header: 'Last Name',
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'customerAge',
      id: 'age' //id overridden, usually not necessary to do this, but can be helpful
      header: 'Age',
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

#### Method 2 - Using an accessorFn and id

You can alternatively use the `accessorFn` property. Here are at least 3 ways you can use it.

In each case, the `id` property is now required since there is no `accessorKey` for MRT to derive it from.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      //simple accessorFn that works the same way as an `accessorKey`
      accessorFn: (row) => row.username,
      id: 'username',
      header: 'Username',
    },
    {
      //accessorFn function that combines multiple data together
      accessorFn: (row) => `${row.firstName} ${row.lastName}`,
      id: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
    },
    {
      //accessorFn used to access nested data, though you could just use dot notation in an accessorKey
      accessorFn: (row) => row.personalInfo.age,
      id: 'age',
      header: 'Age',
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

### Custom Header Render

If you want to pass in custom JSX to render the header, you can pass in a `Header` option in addition to the `header` string property.

> The `header` (lowercase) property is still required and still must only be a string because it is used within multiple components in the table and has string manipulation methods performed on it.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
      Header: ({ column }) => (
        <i style={{ color: 'red' }}>{column.columnDef.header}</i>
      ), //arrow function
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'age',
      header: 'Age',
      Header: <i style={{ color: 'red' }}>Age</i>, //plain jsx with no function
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

### Custom Cell Render

Similarly, the data cells in a column can have a custom JSX render with the `Cell` option.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'salary',
      header: 'Salary',
      Cell: ({ cell }) => (
        <span>${cell.getValue<number>().toLocaleString()}</span>
      ),
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'profileImage',
      header: 'Profile Image',
      Cell: ({ cell }) => <img src={cell.getValue<string>()} />,
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

### Custom Footer Render

If you want to pass in custom JSX to render the footer, you can pass in a `Footer` option. If no custom markup is needed, you can just use the `footer` string property.

The footer cells can be a good place to put totals or other summary information.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'name',
      header: 'Name',
      footer: 'Name', //simple string header
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'age',
      header: 'Age',
      //Custom footer markup for a aggregation calculation
      Footer: () => (
        <Stack>
          Max Age:
          <Box color="warning.main">{Math.round(maxAge)}</Box>
        </Stack>
      ),
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

### Enable or Disable Features Per Column

In the same way that you can pass props to the main `<MaterialReactTable />` component to enable or disable features, you can also specify options on the column definitions to enable or disable features on a per-column basis.

```tsx
const columns = useMemo(
  () => [
    {
      accessorKey: 'salary',
      header: 'Salary',
      enableClickToCopy: true, //enable click to copy on this column
    },
    {
      accessorKey: 'profileImage',
      header: 'Profile Image',
      enableSorting: false, //disable sorting on this column
    },
  ],
  [],
);
```

> See all the column options you can use in the [Column Options API Reference](/docs/api/column-options)

### Set Column Widths

This is also covered in the [Column Resizing Guide](/docs/guides/column-resizing), but we'll also quickly cover it here.

Setting a CSS (sx or style) width prop will NOT work! Material React Table (really TanStack Table) keep track and set the widths of each column internally.

You CAN, however, change the default width of any column by setting its `size` option on the column definition. `minSize` and `maxSize` are also available to set the minimum and maximum width of the column during resizing.

```tsx
const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'id',
    header: 'ID',
    size: 50, //small column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'username',
    header: 'Username',
    minSize: 100, //min size enforced during resizing
    maxSize: 200, //max size enforced during resizing
    size: 180, //medium column
  },
  {
    accessorKey: 'email',
    header: 'Email',
    size: 300, //large column
  },
];
```

You may notice however, that the columns may be not change their size as much as you would expect. This is because the browser treats `<th>` and `<td>` elements differently with in a `<table>` element by default.

You can improve this slightly by changing the table layout to `fixed` instead of the default `auto` in the `muiTableProps`.

```tsx
<MaterialReactTable
  muiTableProps={{
    sx: {
      tableLayout: 'fixed',
    },
  }}
/>
```

The Columns will still try to increase their width to take up the full width of the table, but the columns that do have a defined size will have their width respected more.
