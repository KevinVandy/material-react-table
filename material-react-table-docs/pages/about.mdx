### License

Material React Table is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/KevinVandy/material-react-table/blob/main/LICENSE) and is free to use in both personal and commercial projects.

### Motivation

[`material-react-table`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/material-react-table) started out as an attempt to upgrade the once popular [material-table](https://material-table.com/) library to Material UI v5 and TypeScript, since that project seemed to have become abandoned. However, after a few frustrating weeks, it was discovered that it would be easier and more fun to write a new advanced Material UI table library from scratch. [React Table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) naturally seemed like a great basis for the underlying API and therefore was chosen as the foundation for the project.

### Project Goals

- Stick to material design principles
- Fully enable all features of the [TanStack Table API](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) (as much as reasonably possible)
- Favor performance and bundle size over over-the-top built-in features
- Enable full customization easily (CSS, layout, icons, localization, etc.)
- Be unit-test-friendly
